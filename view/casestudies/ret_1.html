<p style="line-height: 150%;">Known for its wine regions, California is home to some of the world&rsquo;s most recognizable wine brands &ndash; many of which are served at Tannins Restaurant and Wine Bar in San Juan Capistrano, CA. But while the fine wines Tannins serves may improve with age, this was definitely not the case with its video surveillance system.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">When owner Gabriel Sanchez purchased Tannins several years ago, he inherited an analog-based surveillance system that produced very poor image quality. </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t see during the night and if I tried to zoom in on things, we couldn&rsquo;t see anything. It wasn&rsquo;t very helpful,&rdquo; Sanchez said.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">As a fine dining restaurant and wine bar, Tannins offers a number of higher-end wines. For example, it is one of very few California establishments that carries and distributes certain wines produced by Levendi Winery, which retail for up to $65 per bottle. These are among the many wines Tannins stores in a cooled area that features tables and is a popular place for customers to sit. Tannins also features a wine cave that hosts a number of private parties.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&nbsp;The access customers have to areas where wine is stored was one factor that helped Sanchez recognize the need for higher-quality video images, which led to the decision to upgrade the obsolete analog video surveillance system to IP. The upgrade would also be an excellent opportunity to standardize the equipment used for the system, which was another of the existing analog system&rsquo;s shortcomings </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;The old system was a mix of outdated box cameras that were all wired to an old PC; it was horrible,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">Based on cost concerns, Sanchez considered purchasing cameras and recording equipment available at most big box stores, but quickly dismissed that notion because the setup would be too similar to what had been installed previously. His integration partner, Red Hawk Security, then presented a number of options for surveillance equipment, and after researching those options and testing a few, Sanchez chose Samsung as his provider. In addition to excellent image quality, the cameras were much more network-friendly than others he had evaluated. </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;My internet service provider can only give me so much bandwidth because of the limitations of cabling out to the street. One provider&rsquo;s cameras were bringing my network to a crawl because of the bitrates they were putting out. So my POS system and everything else I need to run my business really suffered when I was evaluating those cameras,&rdquo; Sanchez says. &ldquo;With the Samsung cameras, I noticed a significant difference in video quality and what it did to my network. It was able to function a lot better and wasn&rsquo;t clogging up my internet connection, especially when I was connecting to the cameras remotely from my iPad.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">The upgrade involved installing multiple Samsung cameras in various locations throughout the restaurant, including the kitchen, dishwashing area, manager&rsquo;s office, walk-in refrigerator and entries and exits. In addition, there is a camera installed in the liquor closet where extra alcohol and liquor are stored &ndash; a location where Sanchez says some employees &ldquo;have gotten a little sticky-fingered.&rdquo; All of the cameras except one, located on the outdoor patio, were installed indoors. In addition, Tannins is recording all video to a 4TB Samsung SRN-1000 NVR and uses a 24-port Samsung IES4028FP PoE switch to integrate its POS and all cameras. </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">It didn&rsquo;t take long for Sanchez to see the value of the IP system in action. About a week after the upgrade was completed, Tannins&rsquo; morning manager arrived to find that the door had been pried open with a crowbar during the night. After police were called, Sanchez and his team pulled video of the incident, which he says was simplified by Samsung&rsquo;s advanced video analytics feature.</p>
&ldquo;Instead of having to rewind through hours of video like we had to do with our old analog system, we were able to identify the important video very quickly,&rdquo; Sanchez says. &ldquo;When I brought the video to the sheriff&rsquo;s department, they shook their heads because they automatically assumed it was going to be liquor store-quality video. But as soon as I showed them the video, they were amazed. It really opened their eyes and made them realize that these were actually very good cameras.
<p style="line-height: 150%;">Of particular value to law enforcement was video from the office, where the only light overnight was provided by a 15-inch computer monitor. However, Sanchez says, the integrator placed the camera in the office into color mode so it could accurately record what was happening even in the dark. As a result, investigators from the sheriff&rsquo;s department were able to determine the color of the three perpetrators&rsquo; sweatshirts. Despite the fact that they all wore masks, one of the perpetrators wore a sweatshirt with a particularly unique pattern of gray and white stripes. This detail became the key to solving the crime.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;Three hours after the break-in, they had detained three individuals for drug possession, one of whom wore a gray-and-black-striped sweatshirt. Based on that sweatshirt match, they tacked felony charges on to the drug charges and caught them for both crimes,&rdquo; Sanchez says.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">In addition to these types of thefts, Tannins had also been experiencing loss from the inside, whether from employees stealing, over-pouring drinks or giving away too many free drinks. Productivity was also an issue, with some employees simply not doing their jobs. Sanchez believes these incidents were occurring primarily because employees knew that many of the previous cameras didn&rsquo;t work. Since the upgrade, this type of illicit activity has effectively ended. </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;Once the new cameras went in, there was a change in productivity. When I log in to the cameras from off-site and see people standing around, I can text the manager to tell them to get to work,&rdquo; Sanchez says. &ldquo;Likewise, I haven&rsquo;t had one incident with the walk-in fridge area, and my liquor costs have actually dropped because we have cameras in the bar area.&rdquo;</p>
Beyond its security functionality, the new video surveillance system is providing benefits to Sanchez&rsquo; overall business operations and profitability
<p style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;The Samsung system has been a great tool to measure productivity and reduce shrinkage &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also been a huge help with maximizing customer service during the lunch and dinner rushes. If I&rsquo;m in the office doing paperwork and see that the hostess is busy and people are waiting at her desk, I can come out and help them,&rdquo; Sanchez says.</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">In all, Sanchez has been very impressed with the performance of the Samsung IP system &ndash; particularly the impact it has had on Tannins&rsquo; bottom line.</p>
