<strong>AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS:</strong><br />
<br />
Unauthorized Dealer and Warranty Disclaimer Statement<br />
&nbsp;<br />
STA is firmly committed to providing our customers with best in class,
reliable security solution products through authorized dealers. Our
policy is to honor product warranties and to perform services only on
products purchased from an authorized STA dealer. Unfortunately, not
every dealer or retailer advertising STA products has been authorized by
STA. If you purchase a STA product from an unauthorized dealer or if
the original factory serial number has been removed, defaced or altered,
your STA warranty may not be valid.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Products sold on these unauthorized websites or from these unauthorized
dealers may not carry a warranty from STA. When you purchase products
from an unauthorized website or dealer you are taking a risk, because
these products may be counterfeit, used, defective, or may not be
designed for use in your country. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please protect yourself and your STA product by ensuring that you only purchase STA products from an Authorized STA Dealer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To help guide you, we have compiled below a list of known unauthorized
dealers. This is not a complete list, and we recommend you contact us if
you have any doubts. We note that unauthorized dealers may appear on a
marketplace site, hosted by companies such as amazon.com or ebay.com.<br />

                    <p style="line-height: 15.75pt;">Samsung Techwin America (STA) warrants to the original purchaser that&nbsp; STA&rsquo;s products (the &ldquo;Products&rdquo;) are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of three (3) years from the date of original purchase, unless a different period is otherwise expressly stated below (the &ldquo;Warranty Period&rdquo;).&nbsp; STA&rsquo;s obligation under this warranty is expressly limited to supplying replacement parts, repairing, or replacing, at its sole option, any product which STA, in its sole judgment and discretion, determines contained a defect in materials or workmanship at the time of shipment from STA.&nbsp; This warranty does not include on-site service or removal and re-installation costs. This warranty is valid only on STA products and is subject to the limitations and exceptions listed below. </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 15.75pt;">If any person or entity other than STA repairs or replaces parts on the Products without the prior written consent of STA, this limited warranty shall be void with respect to the part or component of the Products so repaired or replaced, and with respect to any other part or component related thereto.<br />
                        <br />
                        For a warranty claim to be valid, you must give full and reasonable written notice to STA of the defect within thirty (30) days of your discovery of the defect, but in no event later than the last day of the Warranty Period.&nbsp; On receipt of any such written notice, STA will, as soon as reasonably practicable, cause to be repaired (or, at the sole option of STA, have replaced) the defect(s) identified by the notice. STA&rsquo;s&nbsp; SOLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REPAIR OR REPLACE SUCH DEFECTIVE ITEMS OF WHICH STA SHALL HAVE RECEIVED TIMELY AND PROPER NOTICE AS PROVIDED HEREIN.&nbsp; ALL REPAIRS PERFORMED BY STA AND ALL REPLACEMENT OF PARTS BY STA SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN AND THE SAME DISCLAIMERS OF OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE DISCLAIMER OF ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR SPECIFIED USE AND THE DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. <br />
                        <br />
                        THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER: malfunction, defect, failure, or damage (i) caused by or resulting from impact, mishandling, tampering, or use contrary to the applicable instruction manual; (ii) arising from ordinary wear and tear, wind, fires, storm, earthquake, incorrect power line voltage, inadequate or improper lighting, adverse weather conditions or other acts of God or nature, your or operators abuse or neglect, misuse, accident or mishap; (iii) arising from shipping; (iv) arising from work, repairs or alterations performed by others than STA; (v) routine cleaning, normal cosmetic and mechanical wear and tear; and/or (vi) parts or accessories manufactured by persons other than STA and warranted by such persons.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 15.75pt;"><strong>You acknowledge and agree, and represent and warrant to STA, that the Products are not and will not be used as consumer goods or consumer products, are not going to be used for personal, family or household purposes, and are intended&nbsp; exclusively for commercial, and not consumer, use. You acknowledge and agree that this limited warranty is exempt from the provisions of the Magnuson-Moss Federal Warranty Act.</strong> Other than as set forth herein, no agent, employee, or representative of STA has any authority to bind STA to any other warranty, or to make any other representations or affirmations concerning the Products or any parts thereof. No affirmation, representation, or warranty made by any agent, employee or representative of STA, shall be binding upon STA unless the same is specifically included within this agreement.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 15.75pt;">To return a Product for repair, a Return for Service Authorization (RSA) number is required. The RSA request form is available on the STA web site at <a href="https://www.samsung-security.com/support/New-Repair-Form.aspx">Samsung-Security.com/repair</a>.&nbsp; In addition to your contact information, you will need the following information in order to complete the form:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p style="line-height: 15.75pt;">The RSA form and return instructions will be e-mailed (or faxed) to you.
